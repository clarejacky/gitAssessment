Step 1: I created a folder on my desktop “gitAssessment” and opened a saved a TEXT file within it. 

Within the command line, I did the following:

Step 2: $ cd  Desktop —> $ cd gitAssessment

Step 3: $ git init - I created an empty repository within this directory 

Step 4: $ git remote add origin https://github.com/clarejacky/gitAssessment.git - I synced a previously created repository on github for this assignment. 

Step 5: $ git add . - I added the TEXT file to the staging area.

Step 6: $ git commit -m “Initial Commit of TEXT” - I committed the file to the repository.

Step 7: $ git push -u origin master - I sent the TEXT file up to the remote repository 

Step 8:  I used the same steps to add the README.md file to github

Step 9: As I made changes to my TEXT file, I would add it, commit it, and push those changes to my github repository.
