Step 1: I created a folder on my desktop “gitAssessment” and opened a textedit file within it. 

Within the command line, I did the following:

Step 2: $ cd  Desktop —> $ cd gitAssessment

Step 3: $ git init - created an empty repository within this directory 

Step 4: $ git remote add origin https://github.com/clarejacky/gitAssessment.git - synced a previously created repository on github for this assignment. 

Step 5: $ git add . - added the TEXT file to the staging area.

Step 6: $ git commit -m “Initial Commit of TEXT”

Step 7: $ git push -u origin master - sent the TEXT file up to the remote repository 

Step 8:  I used the same steps to add the README.md file to github

Step 9: As I made changes to my textedit file, I would add it, commit it, and push those changes to my github repository.
